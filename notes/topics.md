# Topics

## Direction

In the second term, students will cover
<https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/statistical-inference-and-data-analysis>.

They surely need to cover:

* Expressions
* Variables - making something and naming it
* Call expressions
* LHS / RHS

## From the datacamp tutorial

* Maybe `cars` variable in workspace
* `read.table`, with URL
* `dim()`, `names()` on data frame
* `head()`, `tail()`
* `class` to show object type.
* Displaying variables by typing at the command window
* Getting fields from a data frame with $
* Vectors.  Vector printout (element numbers at left)
* Arguments to functions
* Named arguments to functions
* Elementwise add etc on vectors.  Need to have same length
* Elementwise comparisons
* Absolute `abs`
* (`load` of RData)
* (continuous, discrete, categorical, ordinal variables)
* `mean, var, media, summary`
* `table`
* indexing - `dim(cdc)[1]`
* indexing data frames (with integers)
* `cdc[1:10, 6]`, `cdc[1:10, ]`
* `&`, `|` with booleans
* box plots
* formulae as "as a function of"
* "trend line"
* Can mix vectors and data frame columns `boxplot(bmi ~ cdc$genhlth)`
